 *
 * Case1.pml: EPROMELA code of a 
 * contract between a STUDENT and LMS. This model 
 * is meant to correctly implement the English 
 * contract of Fig 4 of this techical report, thus 
 * it accounts for technical failures.
 *
 * To run this code you need 
 * 1) Spin Version 6.1.0 or newer.
 * 2) The macros setting.h and EduOperation.h
 *    vector.lpr and for.h deployed in your
 *    working folder.
 * 3) rules.h in your working folder.
 *
 * 4) Edit Sample.pml to comment 
 * and uncomment the LTL provided
 * in the code as needed. Keep in mind that
 * SPIN can verify only a single LTL at a time.
 *
 * 5) To run the code from Linux type:
 * % spin -a Sample.pml
 * % cc -o pan pan.c
 * % pan -a
 *
 * Notation used in this code:
 * S-success, LF-learning failure, TF-technical
 * failure, TO--timeout, exec--execution
